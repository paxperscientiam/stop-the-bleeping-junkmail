The following is an exercept from a USA Today article [link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/12/09/how-remove-your-info-sites-like-mylife-spokeo-and-whitepages/2619131001/)
> Spokeo
>
> It's the easiest of the sites to work with and most responsive, but it's still a five-click process to remove your data. Start by looking up your name, copying the URL that's been created for you, hitting the BACK button on your browser and then clicking the PRIVACY tab. At the bottom of the page, in small letters, is Opt-Out. Click that, type in the URL you copied and your e-mail address. Spokeo says it will then quickly remove the data. In our tests, it was gone within a day.

> WhitePages
>
> Search for your name, copy the URL created and go to the opt-out page, which is so hard to find, we're just going to give you the URL here: https://www.whitepages.com/suppression_requests. You will then be asked to confirm and then to give WhitePages a reason you don't want your personal information stored in their index. (A drop-down menu offers these choices: The info is incorrect, I'm getting too much spam and junk mail, I'm being harassed and I just want my information to be private.) Then WhitePages asks for you to offer your phone number and get a call back, from which you'll be asked to type in a confirmation code.

> You can save a step by going straight to the privacy policy (hidden way down, at the bottom of the front page). From there, search for your name (and add the state you live in). Then type in your address and request to be let out. The company adds that it "will not sell the email address that you provide as part of the opt-out process, or use it for any other purpose, without your prior consent."
> MyLife
>
> The worst offender: MyLife won't let you opt-out without calling the company first. There's more.
>
> A little background: 
>
> MyLife uses scare tactics to get you to sign up for a membership to see the results. 
>
> For instance, MyLife told me "you have arrest or criminal records" and offered me the chance to view these, provided I pay $1 for a three-day trial membership that could be canceled only if I called in. It also said I "may" have bankruptcies and liens, sex offender notices and eviction reports. 
>
> I bit to see what they had. And it turns out I got what MyLife cited as a "minor infraction" traffic ticket in 1991. That's 27 years ago for what I believe was an illegal U-turn. 
>
> Worst of all, after calling on Monday (888-704-1900) to demand my removal from the index and being asked to give my name, street address and birth date, as of Friday evening, everything was still there. A follow-up call said MyLife takes five to seven business days for removal. The other sites had me down in less than a day.
